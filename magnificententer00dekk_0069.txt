And then so rich an Empyre, whose fayre brest‚
Contaynes foure Kingdornes by your entrance blest
By ‘Brute diuided‚ but by you alone,
, All are againe vnited and made om,
Whos e fruitfull glories [hine so far and eum,
They touch notonely earth, but they kisse beanen, ’
From vv hence Astraea is descended hither ,
Who with ourlast Qeenes Spirit‚ fled vp thither,
Fore-knovving on the earth, she could not rest,
Till you had lockt her in your rightfull brest.
And therefore all Estatesstvhose proper ArtS,
Liue by the breath of Maj estre , had harts
Burning in holy Zeal es immaculate fires,
W ith quenchles Ardors, and vnstaind defires,
To see what they novv see, your powerful Gracc,
RefleEting joyes on every subJeets face·
These paynted flames and yellow burning stripe&
Vpon this roab, being butas shovves andtypes,
Ofthat great Zeale . And therefore in the name
Of this glad Citie‚ whither no Prince euer came,
More lou'd, more long'd for, lowely 1 intreate‚
You'ld be to her as gracious as y’are great:
So with reuerberate Ihoutes our Globe [hau ring,
The Musrcks close being thus z, God saue our King-

If there be any glorie to be vvon by writing these

But hauing peiced vp our wings now againe with
